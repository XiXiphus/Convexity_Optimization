# What is it about?

This repository is going to store the Q&A pair for the book Convexity and Optimization in R^n Exercise written by Leonard D. Berkovitz which is also one of my favourite maths books btw.

Possibly I will solve one exercise per day. Good luck and have fun here :).

# When am I back?
I am currently focused on preparing my submission for AAAI 2025, finalizing the paper and conducting experiments; I will resume progress on this project and provide updates once my AAAI commitments are completed.
